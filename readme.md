# Dir Kit
A simple toolkit for folder and file handling that eliminates boilerplate or wraps used functions in a consistent namespace for easy rememberance/importing.

Dir Kit has no third party requirements and is meant more to be a way to explore writing the same functions with the same signitures in as many libraries as possible. Slowly, over time the number of languages will grow.

## Basic Functionality

- Listing directory contents with fullpath or just item name
- Folder creation
- File + directory deletion using a safety valve
- File + direcotry copying
- Json writing and/or reading, depending on language constraints
- Basic utility wrappers for most common datetime or OS platform getters
